in the installimage script if you want 1 disk with ~6TB set SWRAID 1 and 
SWRAIDLEVEL 0 I changed / to 5gb then left /home as all

1. Update server first apt-update && apt-upgrade
2. Install sudo apt-get install sudo
3. add a user then add that user to the sudoers file
4. make sure you can ssh in with that user before doing #5
5. turn off root logins in sshd_config and change ssh port for security
6. install proftpd with sudo apt-get install proftpd
7. use the config for proftpd I give you just change around what you need

adduser username --home /home/username --shell /bin/bash

/bin/bash for ssh access as well as ftp
/bin/false for just ftp access

if you need to change a users shell for whatever reason it is in /etc/passwd but you will need to use sudo to edit it.

enter in a password

then just use defaults and hit enter a bunch thats it
